# Docker Containers and Kubernetes Fundamentals - personal notes

This repository contains my personal set of notes, based on the video lecture series "Docker Containers and Kubernetes Fundamentals - Full Hands-On Course" from FreeCodeCamp.org [kTp5xUtcalw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTp5xUtcalw). My notes are mostly arranged to serve as cheat sheets for using Docker and Kubernetes. They are broken into the following pages:

- [Docker Cheat Sheet](./docker_cheat_sheet.html)
- [YAML Cheat Sheet](./yaml_cheat_sheet.html)
